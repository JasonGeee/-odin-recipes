        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Good bread choices for a panini include ciabatta bread, ciabatta rolls, focaccia, sourdough, thick Italian bread, and Texas toast, to name a few.
            <br>
            Depending on the size of the panini press or pan, and the size of the bread, you might need to heat the sandwiches one at a time.
            <br>
            If you're using a panini pan, brown the first side for about 4 minutes and then flip the sandwich allowing the second side to turn golden brown, about 3 minutes more.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
            <li>4 slices ciabatta bread</li>
            <li>8 ounces deli-sliced roasted chicken</li>
            <li>2 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>2 leaves lettuce</li>
            <li>4 slices tomato, or to taste</li>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 6 to 8minutes. 
                Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread mayonnaise on one side of the 4 slices of bread. Layer chicken slices, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and bacon, in that order, over 2 slices of bread. 
                Place the remaining 2 bread slices on the top, mayonnaise side down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a panini press over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Place sandwiches inside. 
                Cook until heated through and the cheese starts to melt, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut panini in half and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
